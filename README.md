# Lottery Process Flow Diagram

Lotteries are an excellent use case for Ethereum. This repo will show the process flow diagram of lotteries in Ethereum and Hyperledger to show it's difference

## Ethereum
Following are the process diagrams of the lottery games.

* [Simple Lottery](https://github.com/johnmackyllego/lottery/blob/master/ethereum/simple-lottery/Simple-lottery.jpg) - This simple-lottery is nonrecurring, uses blockhashes for random numbers, and has only
one winner.

* [Recurring Lottery](https://github.com/johnmackyllego/lottery/blob/master/ethereum/recurring/RecurringLottery(eth).jpg) - The
recurring lottery will occur in rounds so that a new prize pool is started every
time the old one closes. It will also allow users to purchase multiple
tickets in one transaction instead of just one and add a couple of security
improvements

* [RNG Lottery](https://github.com/johnmackyllego/lottery/blob/master/ethereum/rng%20lottery/RNG%20Lotter.jpg) - The RNG Lottery is non-recurring, the numbers are randomly generated. Also after the round all users must reveal their tickets or else it will drop.


* [Powerball](https://github.com/johnmackyllego/lottery/blob/master/ethereum/powerball/Ethereum-PowerBall-Flow-Design.jpg) - In Powerball, the user picks six numbers per ticket. The first five
numbers are standard numbers from 1–69, and the sixth number is a
special Powerball number from 1–26 that offers extra rewards. Every three
or four days, a drawing is held, and a winning ticket consisting of five
standard numbers and a Powerball number is picked. Prizes are paid out
based on the number of winning numbers matched on your ticket.
